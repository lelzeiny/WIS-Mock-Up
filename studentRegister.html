	<h2 class="currictext"> General Information</h2>	
<p class="currictext" style="text-align: left">
During the school day the students are provided with snacks which are included in the tuition. WIS students attend classes on either Saturday OR Sunday.<br>
Saturday classes begin at 10am and end at 1pm.<br>
Sunday classes begin at 9am and end at 12pm.<br>
The class day is assigned to the student based on parent preference and availability. WIS holds student enrollment once a year and does not enroll students outside of that period. Please note that the WIS runs at full capacity with a limited number of available seats. The current tuition for enrollment during the entire school year is as follows:<br>
1 Child&#45;$320 <br>
2 Children&#45;$600 <br>
3 Children&#45;$860 <br>
4 or more Children&#45;$1000 <br>
Financial Aid is available for those who apply. No one will be turned away for lack of funds.</p>
